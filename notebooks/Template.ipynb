      "there are a few things that you gotta remember.  Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding chapter of a trilogy.DEWEYA trilogy?RANDYThat's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field, but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned with, because true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the time this thing is through.  Number three; the past will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is not at rest, any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your back.
